# Overview
## Here we are going to implement crud-operations for mongoDB using MongoRepository

# Task
## Implement the FlightInformationRepository.java methods accordingly to the FlightInformationService.java methods and evaluate that the results calling the FlightInformationController stay the same. The methods to implement have the same name as in the service, because we are working with repositories here we have some limitations and need to implement custom queries with the: @Query() Annotation
